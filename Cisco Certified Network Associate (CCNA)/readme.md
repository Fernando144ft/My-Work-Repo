### Approach
To gain basic knowledge, experience, and valuable insights into networking from a Cisco standpoint, I used the **Official Cert Guide CCNA 200-301 Volume 1**, starting with the first Chapter and ending with the 29th, “Building a Wireless LAN.” This, along with LinkedIn courses that complement the content within the textbook fills in the gaps in my knowledge and will support Lab exercises next!

   **Part l**: Introduction to Networking
   **Part II**: Implementing Ethernet LANs  
   **Part Ill**: Implementing VLANs and STP  
   **Part IV**: IPv4 Addressing  
   **Part V**: IPv4 Routing  
   **Part VI**: OSPF  
   **Part VII**: IP Version 6  
   **Part VIII**: Wireless LANs
