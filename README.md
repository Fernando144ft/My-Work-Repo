## More About Me! [Pictures Coming Soon]
* I own three Raspberry Pis: a Pi Zero W, Pi 5, and a Pi 400
<img src = "https://github.com/Fernando144ft/My-Work-Repo/blob/main/AboutMe/Images/Image%203.jpg" style = "width:20%; height:auto;" align = "right">

The Pi Zero W is serving as a security camera configured with [MediamTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx) and a custom script that handles internet outages. It is also covered inside a plant pot; the camera is housed in a 3D-printed case glued to the plant pot. [Example of the code coming soon]

The Pi 5 is currently used as a Qbitorrent server, Samba Share, FTP Server, and StirlingPDF services (currently disabled though).

The Pi 400 was installed with Raspbian Lite (no UI), then I installed the UI afterward, so it does not install any bloatware.

I recently spent some time 3D Printing and designing in Blender.

<br clear="right" /> <br />
  
* I also got into FPV Drones and practice in a Simulator/Game called TRYP FPV: Drone Racer Simulator.
* I built my own desktop PC that I used for everyday assignments, software, games, and editing between 2019 and 2020.
* I have a few VirtualBox Machines (All Kali), although I've used Ubuntu a tiny bit.
* I have programmed a website using the textbook Python Crash Course 2nd Edition (one of their projects).
