## Computer Forensics Laboratory Design

For the computer forensics laboratory at a local law enforcement agency, using the given $1 million budget, I first included the essentials shown in the example: An equipment closet, the evidence locker (which I included on an external room), two workstations (Windows & Mac), and a workbench. According to the textbook, other requirements I illustrated to develop the design, even more, are the mobile device examination workbench, fire extinguisher, field kit storage unit, and cabinets. Although it is not as detailed, some of the hardware that could be stored in the equipment closet are adapters for hard disk drives, write blockers with SATA and USB connections, regular evidence bags, digital cameras, and card readers; while the cabinets could contain information sources: textbooks, articles, and manuals just to mention a few. Above the equipment closet, two field kit storage units can be found for quick access if necessary. Laboratory safety tools like the ABC fire extinguishers are depicted in the image and the mobile device examination workbench can be seen at the top center.

It is important to state that the workstations on the middle left shown in the image are specifically powerful, they would have an advanced CPU, 2 TB of storage or more, and 32GB of RAM or more; this is mainly due to the software and processes that theyâ€™ll use. The workbenches on the middle and right top of the image on the other hand are made for retrieving hardware components that contain crucial data.
